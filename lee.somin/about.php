               <h4>When we buy something in an e-store, we use filters to find things easy and quick. The filter function always includes the “color” section because people consider color as a significant element. If the color could be an important decision-maker, I can apply the filtering concept as a whole store. Most people have a favorite color and pink is one of the popular favorite colors. In PPC, you can buy anything about the color Pink from clothes, cosmetics, toys, accessaries, to even home appliances like small humidifiers or desk stand.</h4>
